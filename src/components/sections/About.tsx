          I&apos;m a frontend developer with a passion for crafting exceptional
          digital experiences using React. I believe that great frontend work
          sits at the intersection of design, technology, and user
          needsâ€”transforming ideas into intuitive and interactive realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          My day-to-day involves working with React, TypeScript, and tools like
          Tailwind CSS to build scalable and maintainable component libraries. I
          love tackling challenges related to UI/UX, re-render optimization, and
          ensuring applications are both powerful and pleasant to use.

          When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me on the football field,
          exploring new routes on my bicycle, or taking a break with my dogs.
