I'm currently building a website for a friend, and it's got me thinking a lot about accessibility and SEO. When I first started web development, I treated accessibility like a checkbox item—something you'd maybe tackle at the end if there was time left. And SEO? That felt like a completely different world of keywords and mysterious ranking algorithms.

But over time, working on projects like this one, my perspective has completely shifted. I've realized these two things are way more connected than most people think. Both exist to make your website understandable and easy to use. Whether someone's visiting with a screen reader or Google's crawler is indexing your pages, the principles are surprisingly similar.

Let me share what I've learned along the way and how my approach has changed.

## Getting the Technical Stuff Right

### Write HTML That Actually Makes Sense

Instead of wrapping everything in generic `<div>` tags, use elements that describe what they contain:

```html
<header>My Website</header>
<nav>...</nav>
<main>
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>We create accessible digital experiences.</p>
</main>
<footer>© 2025</footer>
```

Screen readers use this structure to help people navigate. Search engines use it to understand what's important on your page.

One quick tip: stick to one `<h1>` per page, then use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and so on in order. Think of it like a table of contents.

### Don't Skip Alt Text on Images

Every image needs a description. Simple as that.

```html
<img src="bread.jpg" alt="Freshly baked sourdough loaf on a wooden table" />
```

People using screen readers hear this description. Search engines read it to understand your images

### Meta Tags and ARIA Roles

Your page description helps both search results and assistive technology:

```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Learn how accessibility and SEO work together to improve your website's usability and visibility."
/>
```

As for ARIA roles, only use them when standard HTML falls short. Things like `role="alert"` or `role="navigation"` can help, but overusing them creates more problems than it solves.

### Speed Matters More Than You Think

A slow website frustrates everyone. Google knows this, which is why they track Core Web Vitals:

- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): How quickly your main content appears
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): Whether things jump around while loading
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint): How responsive your site feels

Run Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights occasionally. These tools check both performance and accessibility in one go.

## Design Choices That Help Everyone

### Make Sure People Can Actually Read Your Text

Light gray text on a white background might look sleek, but it's a nightmare to read. Aim for a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (that's the WCAG AA standard).

Tools like Contrast Checker make this easy. Good contrast helps people with visual impairments, but honestly? It helps everyone, especially when you're reading outside or on a phone in bright light.

### Typography Basics

Keep fonts readable and give your text room to breathe:

- Use `rem` instead of `px` so text can scale properly
- Set line height around 1.5 for comfortable reading
- Avoid justified text—uneven right edges are easier on the eyes

When people can read comfortably, they stick around longer. Google notices that.

### Navigation Should Be Predictable

Your navigation should work smoothly whether someone's using a mouse, keyboard, or screen reader:

- Make focus outlines visible (don't hide them with CSS)
- Keep navigation consistent across pages
- Write link text that makes sense out of context: "View Pricing" beats "Click Here" every time

Clear navigation helps everyone find what they need, and it helps search crawlers understand your site structure.

### Design for Phones First

Most people browse on their phones now. Google indexes the mobile version of your site first. And accessibility means supporting different devices and input methods.
Test your layouts on actual devices when you can. Make sure text scales properly and buttons are big enough to tap easily (at least 44×44 pixels).

## Writing Content That Connects

### Keep It Simple

I'm not saying dumb things down, but there's no need to use five-dollar words when simple ones work better. If a middle schooler can understand what you're saying, you're probably on the right track.

### Break Things Up with Headings

Long walls of text are tough to scan. Use headings to organize your thoughts. This helps screen reader users jump between sections and helps Google understand what each part of your page covers.

### Add Captions and Transcripts

If you're posting videos or audio, include captions and transcripts. People who are deaf or hard of hearing need them. Plus, search engines can't watch videos—they need text to index.

### Use Clean URLs

Which would you rather share?

`/blog?id=123`

or

`/blog/accessibility-seo-guide`

The second one's clearer for humans and better for search rankings. It also makes more sense when read aloud by a screen reader.

## Testing Is Part of the Process

Don't just build your site and forget about it. Check in regularly with tools like:

**For accessibility:**

- Lighthouse
- axe DevTools
- WAVE

**For SEO:**

- Google Search Console
- Ahrefs
- Screaming Frog

Both accessibility and SEO improve with ongoing attention, not one-time fixes.

## The Bottom Line

Here's the thing: accessibility and SEO aren't competing priorities. They're actually pointing in the same direction.

When you make your site accessible, you're making it clearer and easier to navigate. That's exactly what search engines want to see. And when you optimize for search, you're usually making the experience better for real people too.

Build for everyone, and you'll naturally build something that performs better across the board. It's really that straightforward.
